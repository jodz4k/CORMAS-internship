# CORMAS-internship

**Context:** Cormas is agent-based modelling and simulations software that is used by researchers in various domains.
One of the most important artefacts produced by Cormas is _simulation data_.
In the past, data was always exported into a file and analysed in some external software, most commonly in R.

**Problem:** Having to switch to an external data analysis tool makes it difficult to quickly analyse models and discuss the simulation results.
Since Cormas is used for participatory modelling, quick prototyping and immediate feedback are very important.

**Solution:** Provide in-image tools for quickly analysing data generated by Cormas simulations.

**Implementation:**
1. Create a data analysis plugin which has dependency on [DataFrame](https://github.com/PolyMathOrg/DataFrame)
2. Add a button to data presenter which would create a data frame and open an inspector with it (this way, users can query the data using standard DataFrame API)
3. Create a new presenter with data analysis dashboard which would display some basic statistics and allow users to apply some common DataFrame queries through user interface
4. Implement more charts (using [Roassal3](https://github.com/ObjectProfile/Roassal3)) to visualize data: line plot, scatterplot, boxplot, etc.
